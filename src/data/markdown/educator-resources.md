# Resources for Educators

## Tips

-   Choose textbooks with a wide range of publication formats.
-   Offer options for different editions of required textbooks.
-   Place instructor-owned copies of class resources on reserve at the University Library [Course Reserves](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/library/coursereserve/index.php).
-   [Adopt Open Educational Resources](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/library/oer/adoptanoer.php).
-   [Create Open Educational Resources](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/library/oer/CreateOER.php).
-   Refrain from requiring access codes as they are typically the most expensive option and cannot be sold back by students after use.
-   Avoid requiring any book that is not going to be used in its entirety.
