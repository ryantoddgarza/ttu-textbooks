# Resources for Students

## Tips

Here are a few tactics that could help you avoid paying full-price for college books this semester.

-   [**Rent**](https://www.bkstr.com/texastechstore/help-faq/textbook-rental): You can rent many of the textbooks you need for the semester, then return them at the end of the term.
-   **Buy used**: The perennial hand me down method has served generations of college students who recycle textbooks.
-   **Buy e-books**: Many textbooks now come in downloadable electronic formats. The downside is that you can’t sell your books back when you’re done with them.
-   [**Document Delivery**](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/library/docdel/): Use the free Document Delivery service at the University Library.
